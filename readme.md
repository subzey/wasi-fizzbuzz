# FizzBuzz

Prints out the [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

This program is not really useful as it is. It's rather a educational project that shows you:

- How to write tiny modules using plain WebAssembly Text as a source.

- How to use [WebAssembly System Interface](https://wasi.dev/) for outputting stuff into stdout.

The source file [fizzbuzz.wat](https://github.com/subzey/wasi-fizzbuzz/blob/master/fizzbuzz.wat) contains lots of comments, go ahead and see!
